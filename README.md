# Compiler
Compiler Development for Custom Programming Language with Defensive Programming in C

1. Developed a front end compiler for a custom programming language, covering buffering, scanning, parsing.
2. Implemented defensive programming techniques for improved reliability and robustness.
3. Optimized memory usage and parsing performance through a custom buffering system.
4. Employed input validation and error handling for error prevention and recovery.
5. Created a lexical analyzer (scanner) with defensive measures for tokenization and integrity maintenance.
6. Designed and implemented a parser using recursive descent for syntax analysis and error recovery.
7. Integrated semantic analysis features (type checking, symbol table management) for program correctness.
8. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and refine compiler design.
9. Conducted thorough testing and debugging (manual and automated) for accurate code generation.
10. Documented design decisions, implementation details, and usage instructions for maintenance and enhancements.

Worked in a pair of two, work load eqaully distributed by each individual.
